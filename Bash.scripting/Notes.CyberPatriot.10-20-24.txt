- In addition to the obvious security vulnerabilites that need to be addressed in Linux Mint 21, make sure to enable UFW or Uncomplicated Firewall. 
- UFW is a front-end for iptables. 
- systemctl status iptables-persistent # command to check for iptables-persistent, which is an iptables restore service. 
- disable said command with # sudo systemctl stop iptables-persistent # then # sudo systemctl disable iptables-persistent # remove with # sudo apt remove iptables-persistent
- check status of iptables with systemctl status iptables
- check UFW status with # sudo ufw status
- enable ports 22, 80, 443, and 21 using command sudo ufw allow 22,80,443,21/tcp, sudo ufw logging on, then sudo ofw logging medium, then sudo ufw enable, then sudo ufw status verbose, then sudo systemctl enable ufw
- Make sure that IPv6 is enabled in UFW by ensuring that IPv6=yes in the /etc/default/ufw file. 
- IPv6 rules should always be placed after the IPv4 rules in sequence. 
- Remember logout command in linux terminal when logging into other people's accounts that are not the auto-login account. 
- Also don't forget to manage startup applications next round. 
- To check if a user exists in Linux type # passwd -S account_name 
- To expire individual passwords in Mint 21, you can use the following command: sudo passwd -e msmith
- Apply protection to home directories for all users. # chmod -v 700 $HOME
- Should you have to undo the last command, you can use chmod -v 750 $HOME. 
- sudo apt-get remove orca speech-dispatcher # removes speech dispatcher which is a screen reader for diabled people. 
- Use update manager GUI.
- Enable automatic updates through the GUI update manager. 
- sudo mintupdate-automation upgrade enable # configure automatic updates from the terminal.
