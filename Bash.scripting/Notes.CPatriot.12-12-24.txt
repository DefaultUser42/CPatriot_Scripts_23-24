Notes for CPatriot State Round FA 2024

Consider making the GRUB menu visible during boot up and changing the boot order to where you are prompted for a password before being allowed into the boot menu.

Also consider seeing what kernels are installed on the system and deleting the ones that we can no longer use. 

uname -r || Will get the kernel version. 

find /boot/config-* || Will get all currently installed kernel versions. 

sudo apt-get autoremove --purge || Will remove all old kernel versions except the latest two. 

Set Chrome to 'Always use secure connections' in the settings menu. Go to 'Settings > Privacy and security > Always use secure connections' and switch it to on. 

Ask Mr. Lieberman if we should enable a private DNS resolver.

If you do the above, also enable DNS over HTTS.
